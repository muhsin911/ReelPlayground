# ReelPlayground
ReelPlayground is a fun and interactive spinning game built with JavaScript. This project simulates a spinning wheel concept where players can spin for random outcomes, just for entertainment purposes â€” no real gambling involved. I do not support gambling; it is a bad habit. This project is purely for learning JavaScript properly.
